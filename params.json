{"name":"CSS Keyframe 'Preloader'","tagline":"CSS Keyframe Preloader [PROTOTYPE]","body":"# Installation\r\n\r\nSimply download the contents in the zipped file, ready the documentation below, and implement it into your project. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo and Information\r\n\r\nBROWSER SUPPORT: http://caniuse.com/#search=keyframe\r\n\r\nTEXT DEMO: http://jsbin.com/omAWEhO/8/quiet\r\n\r\nIMAGE DEMO: http://jsbin.com/eMEKiNo/5/quiet\r\n\r\nThis is how the CSS Keyframe preloader works.\r\n\r\n##Methodology\r\n\r\nHide the inner content of the body, by using the body element itself to cover the content with whatever background you choose. Once the page loads, there is a keyframe that activates and animates the background to cover the content. Special features may be added, for example text or images.\r\n\r\n-Head over to textpreloader.html to see an example of the text preloading animation. \r\n-Head over to imagepreloader.html to see an example of the image preloading animation. \r\n-Note: NO Javascript was used, nor Jquery.\r\n\r\n##Design\r\n\r\nThe body is given a key frame of a very dark color to hide the content, here is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@-webkit-keyframes bodyPreloader{ 0%{background:black;}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis keyframe makes the body turn black, so that all pieces of content are covered from the screen (This piece of code was taken from the 'textpreloader.css' file.\r\n\r\nWhat I did next was bind the animation to the body like so:\r\n```\r\nbody{\r\nbackground-color: #3498db;\r\n\r\n\r\n-webkit-animation: bodyPreloader 3s;\r\n-moz-animation: bodyPreloader 3s;\r\n-o-animation: bodyPreloader 3s;\r\nanimation: bodyPreloader 3s;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen the animation was binded to the element, I needed a way to over the content. So I gave the content an animation to hide itself until the body was done animating using this keyframe:\r\n\r\n[ANIMATION FOR HIDING CONTENT (WHICH WILL THEN APPEAR LATER)]\r\n\r\n```\r\n@-webkit-keyframes content{\r\n  0%   { opacity: 0; }\r\n}\r\n@-moz-keyframes content {\r\n  0%   { opacity: 0; }\r\n  100% { opacity: 1; }\r\n}\r\n@-o-keyframes content {\r\n  0%   { opacity: 0; }\r\n  100% { opacity: 1; }\r\n}\r\n@keyframes content {\r\n  0%   { opacity: 0; }\r\n  100% { opacity: 1; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I binded the animation to the element (NOTE! if you have many elements that make up your content (i.e nav, sidebars, ANY KIND OF CONTENT HOLDING DIV THAT IS NOT PART OF THE PRELOADING PROCESS) must have this animation binded to itself to keep it hidden: In the example below I use only one element (since this page only has one 'content' div being used):\r\n\r\n```\r\n.exampleElement{\r\n[Element Attributes go below]\r\n\r\n[Animations down here]\r\n -webkit-animation: content 1s ease-in;\r\n   -moz-animation: content 1s ease-in;\r\n   -o-animation: content 1s ease-in;\r\n   animation: content 1s ease-in;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere you have it. Now if you would like to add an image (Like SquareSpace) or welcoming text simply make this animation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ANIMATION FOR YOUR EMBLEM (WHETHER TEXT OR IMAGE]\r\n\r\n```\r\n@-webkit-keyframes emblemPreload{\r\n  0%{opacity: 1;}\r\n  50%{opacity: 0;}\r\n  100%{opacity: 0;}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@-moz-keyframes emblemPreload{\r\n  0%{opacity: 1;}\r\n  50%{opacity: 0;}\r\n  100%{opacity: 0;}\r\n}\r\n@-o-keyframes emblemPreload{\r\n  0%{opacity: 1;}\r\n  50%{opacity: 0;}\r\n  100%{opacity: 0;}\r\n}\r\n@keyframes emblemPreload{\r\n  0%{opacity: 1;}\r\n  50%{opacity: 0;}\r\n  100%{opacity: 0;}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd bind it to the elment of your choosing (The one that will be displayed as text or an image with the body animation (See example for reference)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n.exampleElement{\r\n [Element attributes go down here]\r\n \r\n \r\n [Animations go down here]\r\n \r\n  -webkit-animation: emblemPreload 4s ease-out;\r\n  -moz-animation: emblemPreload 4s ease-out;\r\n  -o-animation: emblemPreload 4s ease-out;\r\n animation: emblemPreload 4s ease-out;\r\n \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a prototype as of now. Any ideas are welcomed to improve this prototype of mine. You may modify the code to your liking.
